## Any platform binary help
if you want to use it in any platform as binary, then you can simply build it with [Python 3][1] and it will automatically install for you. <br>

So, go to the main project folder and open your terminal in that folder. But first confirm [Python 3][1] installation.

### Then follow commands bellow:

1. For windows:
    - `install.bat` run as administrator.

2. For Linux:
    - `sudo bash install.sh` in terminal.

After all done, open a new terminal and type `uptime`, `whois` and have fun !
